> Create a **PNG** screnshot of a focused patchwindow (only the canvas, not the frame) 

A new menu item (**shotcanvas**) appear in the main pd menu (it is active only in patchwindows).
Click on that button to create a screenshot of the focused patch. The screenshot (in **PNG** format) include everything in the patch: objects, wires etc. as you see it (the patch can be in edit mode or not).

You will find the screenshot in \<your home dir>/Pd/img/.
>You can change this behavior by editing the value of "img_folder" variable on the top of the main plugin file (shotcanvas-plugin.tcl).

Also a **SVG** file is created, you can find it in the same directory.
>NB, **the SVG file is a simple container** of the png image, it does not contain paths, shapes or other vector elements.

Finally the procedure opens the SVG file with **inkscape** (you must have it already installed).
>you can change program by setting the value of "**edit_program**" variable on top of the main plugin file (shotcanvas-plugin.tcl).

Install
-------

Copy [shotcanvas-plugin.tcl](shotcanvas-plugin.tcl) and [shotcanvas-svgcontainer.tcl](shotcanvas-svgcontainer.tcl) to \<your home directory>/pd-externals.
> this may change, please, refer to the PD documentation.

basically:
1) shotcanvas-plugin.tcl and shotcanvas-svgcontainer.tcl must be on the same level in a directory where pd looks
2) don't rename the files
